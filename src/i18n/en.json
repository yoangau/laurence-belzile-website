Presented at the Vernon Public Art Gallery from January 11 to March 6, 2024, it explored the evocative potentiality of abstraction by showcasing turbulent imaginary places inspired by nature. Through the layering of planes and the use of diagonal lines in the compositions, the works illustrated potential places. In these ambiguous atmospheric spaces, organic forms took shape. The ensemble evoked sensitive, colorful, and hazy landscapes. By using dark and washed-out tones, luminous contrasts were present in the works. These strange chiaroscuros seemed to capture fragments of fictional and nebulous environments.",
        "LB00269-description": "The exhibition “S’arracher la douceur” was presented at Galerie Montcalm in the summer of 2022. The works in this collection featured delicate, elongated forms coexisting with sharp, dark lines and imposing masses that dissolved into a diaphanous surface. Our perception of the pieces shifted between the concrete, two-dimensional painted surface and the illusion of three-dimensionality in the modeled shapes. Some gestures in the compositions stood out, capturing the moment of creation, while others accumulated to create deep, inviting, fabricated spaces. This exhibition invited viewers to fall in love with painting for its sensitive, poetic, and imaginative qualities, as a call to explore the realms of abstract art.",
        "LB00198-description": "\" Au-delà du repli \" was presented at the Champagne and Paradis Gallery in Kamouraska (QC) from October 6 to 22, 2022. The exhibition featured nine abstract paintings along with an artist's book. Both chaotic, poetic, and thoughtful, this book gathers drawings and reflections closely linked to the artist's creative process. The title suggests the momentum that accompanied the artist during the creation of this body of work. Indeed, it proposes a renewal and emancipation of the painter from her own restraints, as well as a respect for her own motivations. This exhibition was an invitation to create connections between the artist's book and the artworks, with the former accompanying and guiding our gaze through them. It allowed us to better understand the artist's motivations, offering an intimate glimpse into the reflections that guide her in the studio. \n I acknowledge the support of the Canada Council for the Arts.

        "LB00350-description": "\"Ces lieux où l’on fait trace\" is a project combining painting and photography, created during an artist residency in Kamouraska in May 2018 and presented during the group exhibition “Voir Loin” at the Kamouraska Art Centre from June 16 to October 8, 2018. For more than a week, Laurence Belzile wandered without a fixed route, with the intention of discovering a new place to explore each day. Roaming this vast territory, from its river to its forests, the artist produced dozens of small pictorial works directly within the landscape. Unfolding in two distinct parts through the mediums used, \"Ces lieux où l’on fait trace\" presents an encounter between Belzile and the territory. More than just a documentation tool in this project, photography serves primarily to contextualize the works. It asserts the precise and concrete position of the artist within the surrounding space during the creation process. The pictorial works, on the other hand, attest to an interaction with the landscape. Their creation acted as an interposition during the artist's contact with the territory, thereby shaping her perception of the place she engaged with. Belzile thus created her works not with the intention of representing the landscape, but rather to bear witness to a lived experience. The resulting works, once presented, act as traces of an intimate dialogue with the traversed spaces; they offer a view of the evolution of an uncommon, yet tangible, relationship between the artist and landscapes transformed into places of creation. Through the spatial arrangement, Belzile proposed a multitude of connections between the works, where the reading of one complemented the other; their components associating to alter their perception. The understanding of each work extended far beyond its own boundaries. This decompartmentalization formed a complex environment with diverse interpretations, reflecting a territory that is composed and constructed through its various natural elements.",

Influenced by the surrounding natural environment, she created on-site artworks which played with the notions of color, transparency, texture, and forms. She set three rules which appeared as the structure of the project: 1. To have no preconceived ideas, only inspirations. 2. Never impose work to herself. 3. Never force a series.",

The exhibition's title invite contemplation on the poetic act of wandering through nature.

        "LB00450-description": "The exhibition J’ai dansé was presented from November 1 to December 15, 2024, at Art-Image in Gatineau, QC. It featured around twenty painted and drawn works, ranging from small to large formats. Through this series, the artist explores abstraction as a means of emancipation, creating a space where imagination can freely unfold. The title I Danced echoes both the intensity of the creative process and the movement present in the works. Characterized by an intuitive and gestural approach, the pieces stand out through the use of pastel colors and curved forms, reinventing visual codes often associated with femininity. Created in the artist’s studio in Vancouver over the past two years, this series also carries the imprint of British Columbia’s coastal and mountainous landscapes. The artist acknowledge the support of the Canada Council for the Arts."

        "content-2": "Artist Statement",
        "content-3": "My practice revolves around abstract painting and drawing.",
        "content-4": "I am particularly interested in the poetry that abstract imagery can convey, in what it evokes in terms of movement, sensitivity, emotion, and intensity.",
        "content-5": "My compositions are characterized by organic forms, often defined by curved lines that contrast with one another and create distinct spaces through plays of color. My works are primarily vertical. I aim to generate sensations through movement within the composition: such as elevation, descent, suspension, enclosure, opening, falling, heaviness, or lightness.",
        "content-6": "My approach to creation is deeply feminist. For a long time, I avoided foregrounding the emotional dimension of my practice, aware that in the artistic discourse, and particularly for women artists, emotion has often been considered simplistic, less legitimate than formal or theoretical concerns. I choose deliberately to reclaim this space: the translation of sensations and personal emotional experiences into visual forms is a powerful contribution, still too often overlooked. Through my work, I bring emotions out of the intimate sphere and inscribe them into the public space.",
