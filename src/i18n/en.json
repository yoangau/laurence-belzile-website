    "LB00234-description": "The exhibition \"Through the Gardens\" brought together twenty small and large-scale abstract paintings and drawings. Presented at the Vernon Public Art Gallery from January 11 to March 6, 2024, it explored the evocative potentiality of abstraction by showcasing turbulent imaginary places inspired by nature. Through the layering of planes and the use of diagonal lines in the compositions, the works illustrated potential places. In these ambiguous atmospheric spaces, organic forms took shape. The ensemble evoked sensitive, colorful, and hazy landscapes. By using dark and washed-out tones, luminous contrasts were present in the works. These strange chiaroscuros seemed to capture fragments of fictional and nebulous environments.",
    "LB00269-description": "The exhibition “S’arracher la douceur” was presented at Galerie Montcalm in the summer of 2022.<br/><br/>The works presented bring together delicate, elongated forms with sharp, dark lines and dense, imposing masses that dissolve into diaphanous surfaces. Perception shifts between the concrete two-dimensionality of the painted surface and the illusion of three-dimensionality suggested by modeled forms. Certain gestures stand out within the compositions, capturing specific moments in the act of painting, while others accumulate to generate constructed, immersive spaces. The exhibition foregrounds painting for its sensitive, poetic, and imaginative qualities, situating abstraction as a site of embodied experience.",
    "LB00198-description": "\" Au-delà du repli \" was presented at the Champagne and Paradis Gallery in Kamouraska (QC) from October 6 to 22, 2022. The exhibition featured nine abstract paintings along with an artist's book. Both chaotic, poetic, and thoughtful, this book gathers drawings and reflections closely linked to the artist's creative process. The title suggests the momentum that accompanied the artist during the creation of this body of work. Indeed, it proposes a renewal and emancipation of the painter from her own restraints, as well as a respect for her own motivations. This exhibition was an invitation to create connections between the artist's book and the artworks, with the former accompanying and guiding our gaze through them. It allowed us to better understand the artist's motivations, offering an intimate glimpse into the reflections that guide her in the studio. \n I acknowledge the support of the Canada Council for the Arts. ",
    "LB00282-description": "From September 18 to November 6, 2022, La Maison des arts et de la culture de Brompton (QC) presented the exhibition ”Les attentes”, an invitation to engage with painting and drawing for their formal, poetic, and imaginative qualities, across both small- and large-scale formats. <br/><br/>Like a proposition that unfolds across space and time, the title refers to a possible event taking place within these abstract works. They present a point of suspension, a moment of restraint—an instant in which the suggested movements intertwine and gradually fade. <br/><br/>Through a delicate yet assured approach, lines are laid onto the surface of the canvases. They divide the pictorial space and position the compositions, giving them a singular anchoring. Lines, and therefore the spaces they create, form the foundation of the artist’s pictorial approach. Through this concrete visual element, compositions are constructed to evoke more than their mere plasticity. The forms unfold through contrast with one another. The pictorial space succeeds in containing them, even as they appear to want to spill beyond its boundaries.",
    "LB00287-description": "From August 14 to September 26, 2021, Manif d’art, in collaboration with the Québec City Library, presented the exhibition “Marmonner le vide” by artist Laurence Belzile at the Aliette-Marchand Library. <br/><br/> Agitated and unfolding across the wall surfaces, the paintings cluster and intersect. The exhibition questions our relationship to the painted medium and prompts a reconsideration of what constitutes abstraction.<br/><br/> Within the works, organic forms are modeled, and the use of line and form coexist. Forms and marks surge and collide, dissolve into the depth of color, and resurface through the abrupt movement of a gesture. Details merge into imposing masses. The works call for a bodily engagement, for a sensitive mode of reading.<br/><br/> “Marmonner le vide” proposes a renewed engagement with abstraction: for its simplicity, for the possibilities offered by abstract visual conception, for the strangeness of the forms that emerge, and for an affection for the incongruous.",

Created over an extended period of time, the drawings accumulate, evoking time, labor, and layering. <br/><br/>Once installed, the body of work evokes the shifting colors of vegetation, the diversity of organic forms, and the multiplicity of natural light. It does not seek to offer a precise representation, but rather a personal impression of nature through abstraction.",
    "LB00333-description": "From July 7 to 31, 2022 at Galerie.a, located at 261 Saint-Vallier East Street in Québec City, Laurence Belzile, Alexanne Dunn, and Éloïse Foulon presented “Alcôve,” a group exhibition bringing together their recent work in painting and drawing.<br/><br/>This exhibition reflects the pictorial connections that unite the artists’ practices. Through the presence of recurring formal elements, exchanges occur between and through the works. “Alcôve” is composed of both individual works and grouped pieces, in which visual connections emerge that were not predetermined during their creation.<br/><br/>This coming together offers an opportunity to reflect on the relationships between real space and pictorial space. The title Alcôve, chosen for the idea it references, an architectural recess, evokes a space within another space. Similarly, the works presented generate their own space within the exhibition site. <br/><br/>The artists would like to thank Anne D’Amours Mc Donald, founder of Galerie.a, for providing the exhibition space.",

    "LB00350-description": "\"Ces lieux où l’on fait trace\" is a project combining painting and photography, created during an artist residency in Kamouraska in May 2018 and presented during the group exhibition “Voir Loin” at the Kamouraska Art Centre from June 16 to October 8, 2018. For more than a week, Laurence Belzile wandered without a fixed route, with the intention of discovering a new place to explore each day. Roaming this vast territory, from its river to its forests, the artist produced dozens of small pictorial works directly within the landscape. Unfolding in two distinct parts through the mediums used, \"Ces lieux où l’on fait trace\" presents an encounter between Belzile and the territory. More than just a documentation tool in this project, photography serves primarily to contextualize the works. It asserts the precise and concrete position of the artist within the surrounding space during the creation process. The pictorial works, on the other hand, attest to an interaction with the landscape. Their creation acted as an interposition during the artist's contact with the territory, thereby shaping her perception of the place she engaged with. Belzile thus created her works not with the intention of representing the landscape, but rather to bear witness to a lived experience. The resulting works, once presented, act as traces of an intimate dialogue with the traversed spaces; they offer a view of the evolution of an uncommon, yet tangible, relationship between the artist and landscapes transformed into places of creation. Through the spatial arrangement, Belzile proposed a multitude of connections between the works, where the reading of one complemented the other; their components associating to alter their perception. The understanding of each work extended far beyond its own boundaries. This decompartmentalization formed a complex environment with diverse interpretations, reflecting a territory that is composed and constructed through its various natural elements.",

    "LB00012-description": "During a one-week artist residency on Anticosti Island (QC), Belzile developed a series of 30 small abstract paintings. Influenced by the surrounding natural environment, she created on-site artworks which played with the notions of color, transparency, texture, and forms. She set three rules which appeared as the structure of the project: 1. To have no preconceived ideas, only inspirations. 2. Never impose work to herself. 3. Never force a series.",
    "LB00218-description": "This exhibition was presented at the Sunshine Coast Art Council Gallery in Sechelt (BC) from February 9 to March 9, 2024. <i>Through the Gardens II </i> presented a collection of six drawings and five paintings that delved into the evocative possibilities of abstraction. Crafted with pencil crayon on wood, the drawings challenged conventional notions associated with this medium, typically confined to childhood, and instead, unveil dynamic imaginary places inspired by nature. The exhibition's title invite contemplation on the poetic act of wandering through nature. Gardens, with their myriad interpretations, parallel the indistinct nature of abstraction within the artist's practice.<i>Through the Gardens II</i> extended an invitation to traverse these abstract landscapes captured in each drawing and painting of this exhibition.",

    "LB00450-description": "The exhibition J’ai dansé was presented from November 1 to December 15, 2024, at Art-Image in Gatineau, QC. It featured around twenty painted and drawn works, ranging from small to large formats. Through this series, the artist explores abstraction as a means of emancipation, creating a space where imagination can freely unfold. The title I Danced echoes both the intensity of the creative process and the movement present in the works. Characterized by an intuitive and gestural approach, the pieces stand out through the use of pastel colors and curved forms, reinventing visual codes often associated with femininity. Created in the artist’s studio in Vancouver over the past two years, this series also carries the imprint of British Columbia’s coastal and mountainous landscapes. The artist acknowledge the support of the Canada Council for the Arts.",
    "LB00501-description": "This exhibition is inspired by the artist’s time in British Columbia, where the verticality of the landscape becomes a visual language. Through a series of abstract works, Laurence Belzile translates the sensory experience of a vast and contrasting territory, intertwining movement, light, and the density of forms. Her compositions, dominated by organic shapes, evoke sensations of elevation, descent, and suspension, recalling the monumental forests of Western Canada, the damp undergrowth, and arid lands. Using dry pastel, graphite, and oil paint, Belzile explores the subtle relationships between abstraction, territory, and sensitivity. Each canvas becomes a space of resonance between memory, material, and imagination. Grounded in a feminist approach, the exhibition reclaims emotion as a vector of thought and a driving force of creation, affirming the legitimacy of the intimate within the public sphere. In «Rencontre avec les Thuyas géants » (Encounter with the Giant Thujas), abstraction functions as a tool for translating lived emotions into visual rhythms. The work asserts the power of embodied experience and feeling as forms of knowledge.",
    "LB00307-description": "From September 12 to October 16, 2019, Galerie AVE in Montreal presented the exhibition “Arracher le rouge du jaune” by artist Laurence Belzile. <br/><br/>The artist favors abstraction for the sense of incomprehension it produces and for the questioning this mode of creation generates. She primarily creates works that present modeled conceptions of non-existent forms. These forms develop within an organic framework, where the use of line is evocative. Among the many disparate elements that may constitute a work, only a few are brought forward in order to privilege simplicity.<br/><br/>Each work bears witness to a single moment: an instant in the painting that may elude our initial perception. These are the sections that disrupt the rigidity of a form or slow the momentum of a gesture. They emerge through certain brushstrokes that break the straightness of a line, or through marks that stop abruptly just before exhausting themselves. All of these precise moments detach themselves from the work to evoke both hardness and fragility; intensity and softness; tension and release: gestures embedded in the painting and in what they propose.",
    "LB00528-description": "\"In December 2025, Alliance Française Vancouver invites you to discover Créatrices d'images, the new solo exhibition by Laurence Belzile, a canadian artist and one of the francophone creators working daily in the AFV’s new studios.<br/><br/> Inspired by three pioneering women artists of the 20th century, Laurence Belzile presents a series of abstract paintings and experimental archives where research, emotion, and creation converge. Each work opens a poetic dialogue between Laurence Belzile’s artistic practice and that of the artists who inspire her.<br/><br/> Through painting and drawing, Laurence Belzile explores abstraction as a space of freedom and imagination. Her compositions play with light, movement, and color to evoke sensitivity, delicacy, and intensity. Her practice affirms the strength of a poetic and subjective form of feminine expression.\""

    "content-3": "My practice revolves around abstract painting and drawing.",
    "content-4": "I am particularly interested in the poetry that abstract imagery can convey, in what it evokes in terms of movement, sensitivity, emotion, and intensity.",
    "content-5": "My compositions are characterized by organic forms, often defined by curved lines that contrast with one another and create distinct spaces through plays of color. My works are primarily vertical. I aim to generate sensations through movement within the composition: such as elevation, descent, suspension, enclosure, opening, falling, heaviness, or lightness.",
    "content-6": "My approach to creation is deeply feminist. For a long time, I avoided foregrounding the emotional dimension of my practice, aware that in the artistic discourse, and particularly for women artists, emotion has often been considered simplistic, less legitimate than formal or theoretical concerns. I choose deliberately to reclaim this space: the translation of sensations and personal emotional experiences into visual forms is a powerful contribution, still too often overlooked. Through my work, I bring emotions out of the intimate sphere and inscribe them into the public space.",
